Vibe Coding Take-Home: VC Intelligence Interface + Live
Enrichment
Build a functional VC discovery interface (Harmonic-style workflows) and integrate a real live data pull
using an AI scraping/enrichment tool. Creativity is encouraged. Timebox: 7-8 hours. Use Lovable /
Google AI Studio / Cursor / v0 / Replit or any vibe-coding platform to ship fast.
Deliverable Deployed app URL + GitHub repo + README (env vars + setup).
Core test Can you ship a usable interface AND wire real enrichment safely (server-side) into the UI?
Deploy Vercel (preferred) or Netlify (acceptable).
Data Seed with mock companies JSON; enrich from real public pages on demand.
Creative brief (aim for "real product" quality)
• Think in workflows: discover -> open profile -> enrich -> take action (save, note, follow, export).
• Make it feel premium: clean typography, spacing, responsive layout, fast interactions.
• Be opinionated: pick a design system and keep it consistent.
Minimum app scope (must-have)
• App shell: sidebar navigation + global search.
• /companies: search + filters + results table (sortable + pagination).
• /companies/[id]: company profile with overview, signals timeline, notes, save-to-list.
• /lists: create lists, add/remove companies, export list (CSV/JSON). Persist in localStorage.
• /saved: save and re-run searches (persist in localStorage).
• Live enrichment: on the profile, click "Enrich" to fetch real public website content via AI scrape and display
extracted fields.
Live enrichment spec (what to show)
• Summary (1-2 sentences).
• What they do (3-6 bullets).
• Keywords (5-10).
• Derived signals (2-4 signals inferred from pages, e.g., careers page exists, recent blog post, changelog
present).
• Sources: list the exact URLs scraped, with timestamp.
Important note (keys + production)
Implement enrichment through a server-side endpoint (e.g., Next.js /api/enrich) so API keys are never
exposed in the browser. Use environment variables and document setup in README.
Use public pages only. Do not attempt to evade access controls.
